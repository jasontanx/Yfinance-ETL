# Yfinance-ETL

I started this mini project as an inspiration from a youtube video (*link provided below*)on a guide to utilise 'yfinance' module for financial stock analysis. 

**Overall ETL pipeline**

**Purpose**

--> To evaluate and analyse share / stock prices

--> To practice ETL / ELT coding

**What is the 'yfinance' package about?**

⭐ yfinance is a Python package that allows user to download historical market data from the Yahoo Finance platform

⭐ Users could easily get the financial related data such as stock prices from the platform 

⭐ It is built on top of the Yahoo Finance API, providing us the access to retrieve hisotrical data for stocks and other investment related data

⭐ Users could utilise the yfinance package to plot charts, calculate returns, analyse trends etc.

**Personal Notes - Plans on the Pipeline**
1. To experiment with argparser
2. Add new features / columns --> 'stock code' & 'stock name' for gsheet ingestion
